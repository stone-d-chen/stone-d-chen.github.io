      <description>The goal is to find the determinant by re-writing \(\Sigma\) as a upper triangular matrix. Then [[Determinant of triangular matrix is the product of the diagonal]]
We add a new row and new column. Recall that the determinant can be defined recursively. Since the new matrix has a \(1\) in the \(\Sigma_{11}\) position, then the determinant remains the same.We aim to eliminate the original off diagonals. We need to remove the lower diagonal for obvious reasons.</description>

      <description>We define \(X_i = [a,b] := X_i = I_{[0,1]}/(b-a)\) the indicator RV over \([0,1]\) normalized such that it integrates to 1.
\[\begin{aligned} X_1 &amp;amp; = [0,1] \\ X_2, X_3 &amp;amp; = [0,1/2), [1/2,1] \\ X_4,X_5,X_6 &amp;amp; = [0,1/3), [1/3,2/3), [2/3,1] \\ \dots \end{aligned}\]
That is we can imagine a box that is shrinking in width while increasing in height.</description>
