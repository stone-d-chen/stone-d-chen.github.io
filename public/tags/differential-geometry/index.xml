Notes on an Introduction to Manifolds (by Tu) Some extremely wordy notes based on An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring W. Tu, mainly to clarify some basis things to myself.
A key concept is coordinate-free objects. In this case, how do we define tangent vectors in a coordinate free way? (But also why do we even care?)
