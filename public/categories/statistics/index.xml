      <description>To overcome the limitations of both the pure model-based and pure design-based frameworks, a hybrid model-assisted framework has been developed. In this framework a statistical model is specified to determine the parameters of interest but estimation and inference of said parameters is done under a design-based framework.
For example consider a model fit on the finite population of size \(N\) as
\[y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i\]
then the finite population quantity of interest are \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) values that minimizes that squared error:</description>

      <description>The postulate of randomness thus resolves itself into the question, “Of what population is this a random sample?” which must frequently be asked by every practical statistician. (Fisher 1922)
When we say our sample set is a sample from a population, what population are we talking about?
In Fisher’s model-based framework, you begin with specifying a statistical model which specifies a data generating process for your \(y_i\)’s. Now imagine we generate and store \(y_i\)’s ad infinitum.</description>
