      <description>The postulate of randomness thus resolves itself into the question, “Of what population is this a random sample?” which must frequently be asked by every practical statistician. (Fisher 1922)
When we say our sample set is a sample from a population, what population are we talking about?
In Fisher’s model-based framework, you begin with specifying a statistical model which specifies a data generating process for your \(y_i\)’s. Now imagine we generate and store \(y_i\)’s ad infinitum.</description>
