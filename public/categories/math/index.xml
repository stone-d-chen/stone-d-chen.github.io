Notes on an Introduction to Manifolds (by Tu) Some extremely wordy notes based on An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring W. Tu, mainly to clarify some basis things to myself.
A key concept is coordinate-free objects. In this case, how do we define tangent vectors in a coordinate free way? (But also why do we even care?)
Tangent vectors in $\mathbb{R}$ as Derivations The book starts with defining tangent vectors to a curve (in $\mathbb{R}^3$) at point $p$.</description>

      <description>Showing a stochastic process is not a Markov chain by exampleThe definition of a Markov chain states that a sequence \((X_n)\) is a MC if the following holds:
\[P(X_{n+1}|X_n, \dots X_0) = P(X_{n+1}|X_n)\]
for all \(x\) values 1That is the probability of what happens in the next step only depends on the previous step. Or put another way, there’s no additional information in \((X_{n-1}, \dots, X_0)\) so “knowing”/conditioning on it does not change the probability of \(P(X_{n+1}|X_n)\).</description>

      <title>A higher level examination of M-estimator consistency proof</title>

      <description>The proof of the [[Consistency of M-Estimators (uniform convergence)]] has two major parts:
converging the “\(y\)” values: by squeezing \(M(\theta_0)\) in between \(M(\hat{\theta}_n)\) and \(M_n(\hat{\theta}_n)\)“\(y\)” values only get close near \(\theta_0\): well separated says that the only place where \(M\) is nearConverging the \(y\) valuesI was originally imagining the first part of the proof using a full \(M(\cdot)\) by \(\theta\) graph but it might be easier to just imagine it as a straight line.</description>

      <title>Walking through the delta method</title>

      <description>Imagine we’ve constructed an estimator \(T_n\) for some parameter \(\theta\) but what we really want to know about is \(\phi(\theta)\), some transformation of the parameter.
Can we use our knowledge of the behavior of \(T_n\) to learn about \(\phi(T_n)\)?
By the continuous-mapping theorem if \(\phi\) is continuous then:
if \(T_n \to \theta\)then \(\phi(T_n) \to \phi(\theta)\)By the delta method we have
if \(\sqrt{n}(T_n - \theta) \rightsquigarrow T\) as \(n \to \infty\)then \(\sqrt{n}(\phi(T_n) - \phi(\theta)) \rightsquigarrow \phi&amp;#39;_\theta(T)\)where \(\phi&amp;#39;_\theta(T) = \phi&amp;#39;(\theta)*T\).</description>

      <title>O notation depends on what limit you&#39;re taking</title>

      <description>Something that confused me about \(O\) notation was that it appeared to take different meaning between algorithms and calculus. This was resolved by seeing that the notation provides a convenient way of describing the limit of a function \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches a specific limit. This point about the \(O\)-ness of a function being contingent on what limit you were taking was the crux of my confusion.
This limit is typically different between a standard algorithms and calculus course.</description>
