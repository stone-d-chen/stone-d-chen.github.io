      <description>Something that confused me about \(O\) notation was that it appeared to take different meaning between algorithms and calculus. This was resolved by seeing that the notation provides a convenient way of describing the limit of a function \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches a specific limit. This point about the \(O\)-ness of a function being contingent on what limit you were taking was the crux of my confusion.
This limit is typically different between a standard algorithms and calculus course.</description>
