      <description>Something that confused me about \(O\) notation differences between algorithms and calculus. The notation provides a convenient way of describing the limit of a function \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches a specific limit..
This limit is different between a standard algorithms and calculus course. In algorithms \(x \to \infty\) while in calculus \(x \to 0\).
For example we have in algorithms:
\[x^2 + x = O(x^2)\quad x \to \infty\]

      <description>The goal is to find the determinant by re-writing \(\Sigma\) as a upper triangular matrix. Then [[Determinant of triangular matrix is the product of the diagonal]]
We add a new row and new column. Recall that the determinant can be defined recursively. Since the new matrix as a \(1\) in the \(\Sigma_{11}\) position, then the determinant remains the same.We aim to eliminate the original off diagonals. We need to remove the lower diagonal for obvious reasons.</description>

      <title>Does convergence in measure imply convergence a.s.?</title>

      <description>No in fact you can have measureable random in probability which also converge almost no where:
We define \(X_i = [a,b] := X_i = I_{[0,1]}/(b-a)\) the indicator RV over \([0,1]\) normalized such that it integrates to 1.
\[\begin{aligned} X_1 &amp;amp; = [0,1] \\ X_2, X_3 &amp;amp; = [0,1/2), [1/2,1] \\ X_4,X_5,X_6 &amp;amp; = [0,1/3), [1/3,2/3), [2/3,1] \\ \dots \end{aligned}\]
That is we can imagine a box that is shrinking in width while increasing in height.</description>
