<h1 id="notes-on-an-introduction-to-manifolds-by-tu">Notes on an Introduction to Manifolds (by Tu)</h1>
<p>Some extremely wordy notes based on <em>An Introduction to Manifolds</em> by Loring W. Tu, mainly to clarify some basis things to myself.</p>
<p>A key concept is <em>coordinate-free</em> objects. In this case, how do we define tangent vectors in a coordinate free way? (But also why do we even care?)</p>
<h2 id="tangent-vectors-in-mathbbr-as-derivations">Tangent vectors in $\mathbb{R}$ as Derivations</h2>
<p>The book starts with defining tangent vectors to a curve (in $\mathbb{R}^3$) at point $p$. We can define a tangent vector to a curve as a vector that lives in the tangent plane to the curve (at point $p$). And the tangent plane is the limit of secant planes. And secant planes are determined by $3$ points on the curve.</p>
<p>This is a bit annoying since this definition relies on defining the tangent vector in terms of Euclidean space but we would like to use a definition that applies to general manifolds?</p>
<p>How do we deal with this? Generally in mathematics we can handle this via Characterizing the tangent vectors. This vaguely means we will say what properties tangent vectors have and then we just re-define tangent vectors as things having those properties.</p>
<p>We do this by characterizing tangent vectors as [[Directional derivative]]s and then more generally as something known as a derivation. Derivations are then coordinate-free.</p>
<h2 id="the-tangent-space-to-a-manifold">The tangent space to a manifold</h2>
<p>We start with the definition of the tangent space (at point $p$) to $\mathbb{R}^n$</p>
<p>$$T_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$$</p>
<p>which we can think of as all the vectors that are tangent to $\mathbb{R}^n$ at the point $p$. This space ends up just being $\mathbb{R}^n$ ^[I&rsquo;m pretty sure all tangent spaces are some $\mathbb{R}^n$] and we&rsquo;ll call a vector in this space $v = \sum v^ie_i = v^ie_i$.</p>
<h2 id="directional-derivative">Directional derivative</h2>
<p>Suppose we have have  $f$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is $C^\infty$ in the neighborhood of $p$. Then the directional derivative of $f$ in the direction of $v$  at $p$ (that is $v$ is defined at $p$) is</p>
<p>$$D_vf = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(c(t))-f(p)}{t} = \dv{t}\eval{}_{t=0}f(c(t)).$$</p>
<p>Then by chain rule</p>
<p>$$D_vf = \dv{c^i}{t}(0)\pdv{f}{x^i}(p) = v^i\pdv{f}{x^i}(p)$$</p>
<p>We can then define $D_v$ as</p>
<p>$$D_v = v^i\pdv{x^i}\eval{}_p$$</p>
<p>or in other words the space of continuously differential functions $f$ at $p$ to $\mathbb{R}$.</p>
<p>$$D_v: C^\infty_p \to \mathbb{R} $$</p>
<p>and associate</p>
<p>$$v\mapsto D_v.$$</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this associate between tangent vectors $v$ and the directional derivative $D_v$ that provides an avenue for characterizing tangent vectors.</p>
