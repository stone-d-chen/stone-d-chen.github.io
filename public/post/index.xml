      <description>The postulate of randomness thus resolves itself into the question, “Of what population is this a random sample?” which must frequently be asked by every practical statistician. (Fisher 1922)
When we say our sample set is a sample from a population, what population are we talking about?
In Fisher’s model-based framework, you begin with specifying a statistical model which specifies a data generating process for your \(y_i\)’s. Now imagine we generate and store \(y_i\)’s ad infinitum.</description>

      <title>A higher level examination of M-estimator consistency proof</title>

      <description>The proof of the [[Consistency of M-Estimators (uniform convergence)]] has two major parts:
converging the “\(y\)” values: by squeezing \(M(\theta_0)\) in between \(M(\hat{\theta}_n)\) and \(M_n(\hat{\theta}_n)\)“\(y\)” values only get close near \(\theta_0\): well separated says that the only place where \(M\) is nearConverging the \(y\) valuesI was originally imagining the first part of the proof using a full \(M(\cdot)\) by \(\theta\) graph but it might be easier to just imagine it as a straight line.</description>

      <title>Walking through the delta method</title>

      <description>Imagine we’ve constructed an estimator \(T_n\) for some parameter \(\theta\) but what we really want to know about is \(\phi(\theta)\), some transformation of the parameter.
Can we use our knowledge of the behavior of \(T_n\) to learn about \(\phi(T_n)\)?
By the continuous-mapping theorem if \(\phi\) is continuous then:
if \(T_n \to \theta\)then \(\phi(T_n) \to \phi(\theta)\)By the delta method we have
if \(\sqrt{n}(T_n - \theta) \rightsquigarrow T\) as \(n \to \infty\)then \(\sqrt{n}(\phi(T_n) - \phi(\theta)) \rightsquigarrow \phi&amp;#39;_\theta(T)\)where \(\phi&amp;#39;_\theta(T) = \phi&amp;#39;(\theta)*T\).</description>

      <title>O notation depends on what limit you&#39;re taking</title>

      <description>Something that confused me about \(O\) notation was that it appeared to take different meaning between algorithms and calculus. This was resolved by seeing that the notation provides a convenient way of describing the limit of a function \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches a specific limit. This point about the \(O\)-ness of a function being contingent on what limit you were taking was the crux of my confusion.
This limit is typically different between a standard algorithms and calculus course.</description>

      <title>Calculating the determinent of an equicovariance matrix</title>

      <description>The goal is to find the determinant by re-writing \(\Sigma\) as a upper triangular matrix. Then [[Determinant of triangular matrix is the product of the diagonal]]
We add a new row and new column. Recall that the determinant can be defined recursively. Since the new matrix has a \(1\) in the \(\Sigma_{11}\) position, then the determinant remains the same.We aim to eliminate the original off diagonals. We need to remove the lower diagonal for obvious reasons.</description>

      <title>WIP - Does convergence in measure imply convergence a.s.?</title>

      <description>We define \(X_i = [a,b] := X_i = I_{[0,1]}/(b-a)\) the indicator RV over \([0,1]\) normalized such that it integrates to 1.
\[\begin{aligned} X_1 &amp;amp; = [0,1] \\ X_2, X_3 &amp;amp; = [0,1/2), [1/2,1] \\ X_4,X_5,X_6 &amp;amp; = [0,1/3), [1/3,2/3), [2/3,1] \\ \dots \end{aligned}\]
That is we can imagine a box that is shrinking in width while increasing in height.</description>
