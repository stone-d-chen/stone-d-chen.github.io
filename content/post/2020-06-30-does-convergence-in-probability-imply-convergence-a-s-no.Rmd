No in fact you can have measureable random in probability which also converge almost no where:

We define $X_i = [a,b] := X_i = I_{[0,1]}/(b-a)$ the indicator RV over $[0,1]$ normalized such that it integrates to 1.

$$\begin{aligned} X_1 & = [0,1] \\ X_2, X_3 & = [0,1/2), [1/2,1] \\ X_4,X_5,X_6 & = [0,1/3), [1/3,2/3), [2/3,1] \\ \dots \end{aligned}$$

That is we can imagine a box that is shrinking in width while increasing in height.
