<p>We define <span class="math inline">\(X_i = [a,b] := X_i = I_{[0,1]}/(b-a)\)</span> the indicator RV over <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> normalized such that it integrates to 1.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned} X_1 &amp; = [0,1] \\ X_2, X_3 &amp; = [0,1/2), [1/2,1] \\ X_4,X_5,X_6 &amp; = [0,1/3), [1/3,2/3), [2/3,1] \\ \dots \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>That is we can imagine a box that is shrinking in width while increasing in height.</p>
