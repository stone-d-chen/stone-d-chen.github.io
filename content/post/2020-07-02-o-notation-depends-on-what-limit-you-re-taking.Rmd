Something that confused me about $O$ notation differences between algorithms and calculus. The notation provides a convenient way of describing the limit of a function $f(x)$ **as $x$ approaches a specific limit.**.

This limit is different between a standard algorithms and calculus course. In algorithms $x \to \infty$ while in calculus $x \to 0$.

For example we have in algorithms:

$$x^2 + x = O(x^2)\quad x \to \infty$$

since 

$$\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x^2 + x}{x^2} = 1$$


but in calculus we would ask $x \to 0$ (typically) so:

$$\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x^2 + x}{x^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{x}$$

which diverges.
