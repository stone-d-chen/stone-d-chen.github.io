<p>Something that confused me about <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> notation was that it appeared to take different meaning between algorithms and calculus. This was resolved by seeing that the notation provides a convenient way of describing the limit of a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> <strong>as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> approaches a specific limit</strong>. This point about the <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>-ness of a function being contingent on what limit you were taking was the crux of my confusion.</p>
<p>This limit is typically different between a standard algorithms and calculus course. In algorithms <span class="math inline">\(x \to \infty\)</span>, while in calculus <span class="math inline">\(x \to 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example we have in algorithms:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x^2 + x = O(x^2)\quad x \to \infty\]</span></p>
<p>since</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x^2 + x}{x^2} = 1\]</span></p>
<p>but in calculus we would ask <span class="math inline">\(x \to 0\)</span> (typically) so:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x^2 + x}{x^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{x}\]</span></p>
<p>which diverges.</p>
